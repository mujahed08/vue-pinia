## AI & ML
1. **AI (Artificial intilegence)**
    * Conceptualize the basic ideas and techniques underlying the design of intelligent systems.
    * This  generally  involves  borrowing characteristics  from  human  intelligence,  and  applying  them  as  algorithms  in  a  computer friendly  way.
    * Knowledge of Maths, Psychology, Cognition,  Biology and Philosophy also require. 
    * What is intelligence: 
        1. Intelligence is a property of mind that encompasses many related mental abilities, such as the capabilities to
            * reason
            * plan
            * solve problems
            * think abstractly
            * comprehend ideas and language and
            * learn

            * Algorithms
            * Heruistics
                * Representives heruistics (e.g. sterotype)

                * Working backward
                * Subgoals
                * Insights
        * Problems with problem solving and decision making
            * Functional fixedness
            * Mental sets
            * Confirmation bias
        * Creativity
            * Divergent thinking is the reverse of convergent thinking, which often makes connections and links at level of conciouusness just below alert awareness.
            * Divergent thinkers will obviously less prone to problem solving, such as functional fixedness.
            1. Creative people usually have broad range of knowledge about lot of subjects and are good at using mental imagery.
            2. Creative people aren't affraid to be different - they are open to new experiences than many people, and they tend to have more vivid dreams and daydreams than others do.

            3. Freewriting: Write down or record everything that comes to mind about a topic without revising or proofreading until all of the information is written or recorded in some way. Organize it later.
            4. Mind or Subject Mapping: Start with a central idea and draw a "map" with lines from the center to other related ideas, forming a visual representation of the concepts and their connections.
